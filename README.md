# l3_maths_quiz

A children's math quiz game from only JS, HTML, and (maybe?) a CSS framework.

# Context:

You work as a junior programmer for an educational charity which supports young children in developing Maths skills. You have been asked to develop a mobile app which will help children improve their mental arithmetic.
The app should run a game where the user has to answer a series of simple random arithmetic questions (add, subtract, multiply and divide) using whole numbers between 1 and 12. Subtraction and division should not produce negative answers. Each game should have 10 questions and the app should keep track of the score. Three levels should be provided, level 0 has no time limit, level 1 has a 20 second time limit per question and level 2 has a 10 second time limit per question. The app should include suitable graphics and sounds (e.g. applause when a correct answer is entered) to make it more engaging for young children.

# Tasks remaining:

- [done] set up the 3 levels with appropriate time limits; starting with zero then one then two.
- [done] add styling
- add images/graphics
- [done] add sounds
- finalise PWA for installing
- [done] text validation on name input [used-backend-validation]
- [done] save image to storage
